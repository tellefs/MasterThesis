 The Oslo-method
 
 1. Sort ALFNA(Eg,Ex) from experiment 
 2. Use rm in mama and unfold ALFNA -> unfolded 
 3. Use fg in mama and extract first-generation matrix fg 
 4. Run rhosigchi on fg 
 5. Run counting 
 6. Run counting.kumac, spincut.kumac and sigext.kumac in PAW
    or run counting.cpp, spincut.cpp and sigext.cpp in ROOT
 7. Run normalization 
 8. Run strength.kumac in PAW or strength.cpp in ROOT
